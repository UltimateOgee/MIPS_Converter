A program to convert a line 
or lines of MIPS assembler to a text form of its binary representation. 
Such a program could range from fairly simple (only a subset of instructions, 
limited or no support for labels) to fairly complex

//My program supports about 18 instructions. This is nearly half of the MIPS instructions.
//It supports common instructions from R, I, and J types.
//The program (aka assembler) can also recognize labels which took some thinking
//I focused on the MIPS instructions people are more likely to use.
//It took about 11 hours of work more or less.21_2019_Singh
